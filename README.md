# Dog-Breed-Classifier
A Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project used to identify Dob Breeds.

## Project Overview
This project involved building a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images to classify dog breeds. After training the network with 133 breeds of dogs, the algorithm is able to identify canine breeds of dogs. Likewise, if supplied with an image other than that of a dog, the network is able to detect that the image supplied is not a dog.
